# basic-statistics-workshop

This workshop illustrates how basic statistical concepts can be applied to the analysis of biomolecular simlation data. Using as an example some of the data from [Shaw et al.'s millisecond MD simulation of BPTI](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6002/341.full), we investigate a series of increasingly rigorous statistical approaches to answering a simple question: what is the average distance between the N- and C-terminal amino acids in the simulation?

## Requirements
A basic knowledge of Python and MD simulation methods.

## Training material
A Jupyter notebook and associated data files.
